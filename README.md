## What is Blackout?
**Blackout** is a game where you need to escape dark mazes, while equipped with only a lantern. The game has two modes, each with its own particularities:


### Time attack mode
* Complete as many puzzles as you can within the time limit
* Pick up buffs that help you along the way
* The puzzles keep increasing in size and difficulty

### Puzzle mode
* Roam around a maze and find the 4 diamonds needed to unlock the door
* Escape the maze in as little time as possible
* Pick up items to help you along the way

## How to download Blackout
If you already have Greenfoot installed, you may download the *Source Code* folder and run the *project* file. This enables you to play the game, as well as look through the source code, if you're curious about how the game works.

Otherwise, enter the *Builds* folder, and clone the folder of the last version of **Blackout**. This will enable you to play the game without having Greenfoot installed. However, you still require the JRE.

*Note: It is also possible to only download the .jar file if you want to play the game, but do not care about the scoring system. The other 2 files are only for score management and do not impact the game otherwise.*

For the sake of keeping, beta versions of **Blackout** will also be provided, however, they are highly incomplete at best and downright broken at worst. Only the finished releases of **Blackout** will have a pre-built .jar file.
